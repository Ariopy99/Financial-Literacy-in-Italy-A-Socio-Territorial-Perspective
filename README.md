📊 Financial Literacy and Socio-Demographic Determinants in Italy
This project investigates the level of financial literacy in Italy and how socio-demographic characteristics influence individuals' financial behaviours, knowledge, and decision-making abilities.

🧠 Context
Financial literacy is a critical skill for individual and household economic well-being. It enables better decision-making regarding saving, investment, credit use, and retirement planning, helping to reduce economic instability and social inequality.

Despite its importance, Italy consistently ranks among the lowest in financial literacy across Europe and OECD countries. This knowledge gap hampers citizens' ability to manage risk, plan for the future, and benefit from financial opportunities.

📉 The Problem
Many Italians struggle with basic financial concepts such as compound interest and risk diversification.

A lack of financial competence leads to poor economic choices, over-indebtedness, and insecurity regarding long-term financial stability.

Existing efforts, such as awareness campaigns, have proven insufficient in addressing these structural deficiencies.

📌 Project Objectives
This project broadens the analysis by examining how socio-demographic variables influence:

Financial knowledge

Risk attitudes

Openness to financial products

Long-term investment strategies

Retirement preparedness

Daily financial behaviours (e.g., budgeting, paying bills, saving)

🗂 Dataset
We use the Financial Literacy dataset, accessible in the repository. 

🛠 Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values.

Exploratory Analysis: Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.

Modeling: Construction and comparison of predictive models to identify the socio-demographic drivers of financial behaviour.

Evaluation: Model performance assessed using classification metrics and interpretability tools.

🎯 Expected Outcomes
Identify population segments most at risk of poor financial behaviour.

Understand the key socio-demographic predictors of sound financial decision-making.

Generate evidence-based policy recommendations, such as:

Context-sensitive financial education in schools.

Personalized adult learning programs.

Incentives for long-term financial planning and risk awareness.

❓ Key Research Questions
How do factors like age, education, income, or geographic location affect financial literacy?

Which variables are the strongest predictors of positive or negative financial behaviour?

What interventions can help close the financial literacy gap in Italy?
